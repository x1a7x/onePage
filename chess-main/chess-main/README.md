## Features

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Instant feedback is provided for each attempt:
  - **Correct**: The message is displayed in green.
  - **Incorrect**: An informative message is displayed in red, indicating which square was clicked.
- **Toggle Coordinates Button**: Easily toggle visibility of the coordinate labels on each square for better learning.
- **Next Button**: Request a new random square to continue your practice and improve your knowledge.

2. **Start Practicing**:
